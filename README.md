<h2>San Francisco, the nest of Startups</h2>

<h3>The American city where the big fishes started: Apple, Linkedin, Facebook, Google... If they started there, there must be a reason!</h3>

<p>The project was to locate a city to establish our new company. Keeping in mind the needs of the employees so the impact of the change is as pleasant as possible for everyone. The list of employees was as follows:</p>

<p>* 20 Designers
* 5 UI/UX Engineers
* 10 Frontend Developers
* 15 Data Engineers
* 5 Backend Developers
* 20 Account Managers
* 1 Maintenance guy that loves basketball
* 10 Executives
* 1 CEO/President

And the needs of each of them:

* Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
* 30% of the company have at least 1 child.
* Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
* Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not to far.
* Account managers need to travel a lot
* All people in the company have between 25 and 40 years, give them some place to go to party.
* Nobody in the company likes to have companies with more than 10 years in a radius of 2 KM.
* The CEO is Vegan

<p>We started cleaning the dataset in order to filter some of the needs of the employees, such as being close to startups that generate an average of $ 1 million, locating companies that are more than 10 years old to keep them at least 2 km away, and finally locate the design companies to be close at least of one of them, as our designers requested.</p>


<p>Then we have used the Foursquare API resources to locate the coordinates of the following needs: schools for children, nearby Starbucks for executives, nearby airport for account managers, places to party, even a basketball stadium for our maintenance guy and last but not least a good vegan restaurant for our CEO.
Thanks to Foursquare we managed to make a dataframe with the names and coordinates of all the sites mentioned above.
Once we had the data from the company filter and the API we drew our conclusion.
The perfect place for our new office is: San Francisco, specifically in the Financial District. In addition to covering all the needs, California has one of the best climates in the world so that our employees can enjoy 365 days of sunshine and the long California beaches.</p>
